"They say I'm the greatest shaman now, nobody does it better, maybe they're right."

notes: "If we think of sorcery as a simplified term for [...] invisible maleficense - as with 'fake news' or, more to the point, the attribution of 'fake news' - then we can discern how a figure like Trump, buoyed up by the magic of the presidency ('In God We Trust'), finds his mojo."

"This multiplicity of stories destabilized me and the moorings that [...] I thought I required for sociological reckoning." (p36). "The 'shamanic' element in all of this lay in the clouds of uncertainty and rumor" (p37)

"For those who oppose this tooth and nail it seems that language and imagery fail us when we most need them, and do so spectacularly in a liberal, secular environment." (p40)

We're unprotected, we don't know how to engage with this kind of sorcery.

__And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul.__ <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

notes: "Speaking rapid-fire with no spot for others to jump into the conversation, Mr. Trump makes everyone a co-conspirator to his preferred set of facts, or delusions. I have felt it - this president building with his words a web of alternative reality and busily wrapping it around all of us in the room... __And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul.__"
