## quotes from Taussig

p35. "My overarching idea is 'shamanic' in the sense of the actual hallucinogen-based shamanism I experienced [...] in the Putumayo basin of Colombia. What was hallucinatory in ritual involved multiple realities cascading into each other's otherness, along with fluctuating paranoia amid uncertainty and bodily fragmentation carried aloft by the shaman's song in stops and startss the night long."

p36. "If we think of sorcery as a simplified term for [...] invisible maleficence - as with 'fake news' or, more to the point, the attribution of 'fake news' - then we can discern how a figure like Trump, buoyed up by the magic of the presidency ('In God We Trust'), finds his mojo."

p36. "This multiplicity of stories destabilized me and the moorings that [...] I thought I required for sociological reckoning. [...] But then what do do with the empirical reality of multiple realities, of what is now [...] called a 'post-truth' era? Later it seemed to me that a more cinematic and less sociological mode of reckoning was required of me, a mode attuned to what is called montage, in which different realities and different images are juxtaposed one to the other."

"The 'shamanic' element in all of this lay inthe clouds of uncertainty and rumor"

p37. Of the people who called Trump an idiot: "They were right, of course, but they were wrong too." And then he speaks of his power, like a shaman, to conjure a world and trap people in it, for good or evil. "The deposted head of the fBI, an organization as sinister as you can get, put it well, as only a victim mimetically in synch with his antagonist could: 'Speaking rapid-fire with no spot for others to jump into the conversation,' noted james Comey, 'Mr. Trump makes everyone a co-conspirator to his preferred set of facts, or delusions. I have felt it - this president building with his words a web of alternative reality and busily wrapping it around all of us in the room... And then you are lost. He has eaten your soul."

Writes Taussig: "This is FBI 'shaman-speak' at its best.
